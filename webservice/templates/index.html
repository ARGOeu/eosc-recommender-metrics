        The Recommender System (RS) is a novel component of the EOSC Portal meant to improve user experience. It
        provides EOSC users with recommendations concerning resources that could be of their interest, based on a
        multi-focal perspective of the users. Measuring the success of such system is crucial to get valuable insights
        in many aspects that affect user experience. In this approach, an independent metrics framework as a service is
        being introduced to support the evaluation and adaptation of recommendation mechanisms. The use of additional
        diagnostic metrics and visualizations offers deeper and sometimes surprising insights into a modelâ€™s
        performance. The evaluation is quantitatively being performed by processing information such as resources, user
        actions, ratings, and recommendations in order to measure the impact of the AI-enhanced services and user
        satisfaction as well as to incorporate this feedback and improve the services provided, via a user-friendly API
        and dashboard UI.
