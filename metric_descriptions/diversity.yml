name: Diversity Shannon Entropy

summary: > 
    Measures Recommendations' diversity. The entropy is 0 when a single item is always chosen or recommended, 
    and log n when n items are chosen or recommended equally often.

description: > 
    The diversity (\(H\)) of the recommendations according to Shannon Entropy. The entropy is 0 when a single item 
    is always chosen or recommended, and log(n) when n items are chosen or recommended equally often 
    (see book \(\href{https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4939-7131-2_110158}{https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4939-7131-2_110158}\)). Generally, the Shannon Entropy mathematical expression is defined as: 
    $$H=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}p(i)\log_2 p(i) $$In RS Metrics the computation is determined by the following forumla: 
    $$Diversity=-\sum_{i=1}^{services}\left(\frac{count(i)}{recommendations}\right)\log_2 \left(\frac{count(i)}{recommendations}\right)$$

output:
    type: float
    min: 0
    max: +\(\infty\)
    comment: The entropy is 0 when a single item is always chosen or recommended, and log n when n items are chosen or recommended equally often.

prerequisites:
    - recommendations without anonymous users
    - all available services

process:
    - step: Clean up
      details: >
        Recommendations clean up; entries removal where users or services are not found in "users" or "services" files accordingly
    - step: Services Impact
      details: >
        Calculation of the impact of the services, by counting how many times each service i was suggested to all possible users: count(i)
    - step: Recommended Probability of the Services
      details: >
        For each service calculate its recommended probability by dividing the number of service's occurrences found in the recommendations to the total number of recommendations
    - step: Service-based product computation
      details: >
        Calculation of the product of the recommended probability from previous step and the logarithmic value of it, for each service individually
    - step: Shannon Entropy computation
      details: >
        Computation of the overall value by summing all values from previous step
