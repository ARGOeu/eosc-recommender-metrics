summary: > 
    Measures Recommendations' accuracy based on users' access to the services. A value of 1, indicates that the RS model got all the predictions right, and a value of 0 indicates that the RS model did not make a single correct prediction

description: > 
    The accuracy (\(A\)) of the recommendations is based on users' access to the services. A value of 1, indicates that the RS model got all the predictions right, and a value of 0 indicates that the RS model did not make a single correct prediction. Generally, the Accuracy mathematical expression is defined as: 
    $$A=\frac{Number\;of\;correct\;predictions}{Total\;number\;of\;predictions}$$In RS Metrics the computation is determined by the following formula: 
    $$Accuracy=\frac{Number\;of\;correctly\;recommended\;services}{Total\;number\;of\;services}$$where correctness is defined as if the service is both accessed by the user and also it is recommended by the RS

output:
    type: float
    min: 0
    max: 1
    comment: A value of 1, indicates that the RS model got all the predictions right, and a value of 0 indicates that the RS model did not make a single correct prediction.

prerequisites:
    - recommendations without anonymous users
    - all available users (with their accessed services)
    - all available services

process:
    - step: Clean up
      details: >
        Recommendations clean up; entries removal where users or services are not found in "users" or "services" accordingly
    - step: Vector creation of the Accessed Services
      details: >
        For each user create a vector at the size of the number of the services, and assign a binary value for each service with a value of 1 if it is found in the user's accessed services, or 0 if it is not
    - step: Vector creation of the Recommended Services
      details: >
        For each user create a vector at the size of the number of the services, and assign a binary value for each service with a value of 1 if it is recommended to the user, or 0 if it is not
    - step: Accuracy score computation
      details: >
        For each user compute the average value of the difference vector; a vector which states True if service is found in both accessed and recommended vectors or False if it is not
    - step: Mean value of Accuracy score
      details: >
        Computation of the overall value by calculating the mean value of each user's accuracy score
