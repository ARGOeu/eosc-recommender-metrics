name: Diversity Gini Index

summary: > 
    Measures Recommendations' diversity. The index is 0 when all items are chosen equally often, and 1 when a single item is always chosen.

description: > 
    The diversity of the recommendations according to Gini Index. The index is 0 when all items are chosen equally often, 
    and 1 when a single item is always chosen (see book \url{https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4939-7131-2_110158}). Initially, the Gini Index (H) is defined as: 
    $$G=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(2j-n-1)p(i_j)$$where $$i_1,\ldots,i_n$$ is the list of items ordered according to increasing $$p(i)$$ and each item $$i$$ accounts for a proportion $$p(i)$$ of user recommendations. In RS Metrics the computation is determined by the following forumla: 
    $$G=1-\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{rec\_services}[2(i+1+services-rec\_services)-services-1]\frac{count(i)}{recommendations}}{services-1}$$, where $$count(i)$$ indicates how many times service $$i$$ has been recommended.

    comment: The index is 0 when all items are chosen equally often, and 1 when a single item is always chosen.

prerequisites:
    - recommendations without anonymous users
    - all available services

process:
    - step: Clean up
      details: >
        Recommendations clean up; entries removal where users or services are not found in "users" or "services" files accordingly
    - step: Services Impact
      details: >
        Calculation of the impact of the services, by counting how many times each service i was suggested to all possible users: count(i)
    - step: Sort Services Impact from low to high
      details: >
        Sort the number of how many times each service (i.e. i) was suggested from the lower to the higher value, in order to apply the respective weight (i)
    - step: Calculate the opposite of the Gini index computation
      details: >
        Calculation of the opposite of the Gini Index (1-G) by applying the suggested formula
    - step: Calculate Gini Index and normalize it
      details: >
        Computation of the Gini Index and divide it by the number of services
