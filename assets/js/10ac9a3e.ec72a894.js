The software calculates statistics, metrics, KPIs, and visualizations to measure the success of the RS that offer deeper insights into the performance of the system.

Subsequently, RMF will perform the next phase's steps which are: processing the data, computing the designated evaluation metrics, and uniformly presenting the resulting information.
